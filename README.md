# phil.ewels.co.uk

The repository holds the code used on my website, [phil.ewels.co.uk](http://phil.ewels.co.uk).

The current iteration was developed in 2023. For earlier versions of the website, see the other repository branches.

Most of the website code is now hand-written, but some parts of it were built using the Astro template [manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website). Most of that code has since been stripped out and replaced, but it was helpful when getting started with Astro.
