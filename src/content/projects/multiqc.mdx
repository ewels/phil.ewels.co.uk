MultiQC is a reporting tool designed to aggregate output from bioinformatics analyses into a single comprehensive report. It works by scanning results from multiple analysis tools and combining them into a single, user-friendly HTML report.

MultiQC is particularly useful in large-scale projects, where manual inspection of individual tool outputs would be tedious and error-prone. It standardises reporting, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across datasets.

I began writing MultiQC at SciLifeLab, as we needed a better QC reporting tool for the large projects that we were running.
While it is not a particularly complex tool, it has been a great case of "right place at the right time".
It unwittingly has become the _de-facto_ reporting tool for much of bioinformatics (certainly genomics) and now supports hundreds of bioinformatics tools with many if not most modules written by the community.
When I joined Seqera in 2022, MultiQC also became part of the Seqera family.

MultiQC is open-source and available on GitHub at [MultiQC/MultiQC](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC). The tool has been widely adopted in the bioinformatics community and is used across a range of fields, from genomics to transcriptomics, making it an essential part of modern data processing pipelines.
