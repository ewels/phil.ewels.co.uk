[SRA-explorer](https://sra-explorer.info) is a web-based tool designed to simplify searching and downloading data from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). It allows researchers to quickly identify datasets of interest and retrieve download links for further analysis.

Researchers can use SRA-explorer to:

- Search for publicly available sequencing datasets by keyword, accession number, or study name.
- View detailed metadata for each dataset, including sequencing technology, sample information, and read length.
- Get direct download links for data in both FastQ and SRA formats, avoiding the need to manually generate them.
- Automatically generate `fastq-dump` commands, which can be copy-pasted into the command line to retrieve data with ease.

SRA-explorer is especially helpful for bioinformaticians who need to gather data for large-scale reanalysis or meta-analyses. It eliminates the complexity of navigating the SRA interface and saves time by providing the necessary download commands in a single step.

Some key features include:

- **Advanced Search:** Perform deep searches of the SRA database with intuitive filters and sorting options to find relevant datasets quickly.
- **Direct Links:** Retrieve ready-to-use download links for fastq files, making it easy to access data for downstream analysis.
- **Command Generation:** Automatically generate `fastq-dump` commands, streamlining the process of retrieving data without needing to navigate the SRA's web interface.
- **Simplicity:** The web interface is easy to use, even for those who are not deeply familiar with the SRA, and it speeds up the dataset retrieval process significantly.

SRA-explorer has helped researchers access sequencing data from across the globe for reuse and analysis. It's particularly useful for those looking to avoid the clunky interface of the NCBI SRA and directly obtain data in formats ready for analysis.

The source code for SRA-explorer is open-source and available on GitHub at [ewels/sra-explorer](https://github.com/ewels/sra-explorer).
