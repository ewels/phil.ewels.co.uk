Labrador is a web based tool to manage projects and automate the processing of publicly available datasets.

Researchers can use Labrador to:

- Browse and search previously processed datasets
- View processing and analysis reports in their web browser
- Download data through their web browser
- Request new datasets, with required information automatically retrieved from accession numbers

Bioinformaticians can use Labrador to:

- Speed up retrieval of project information from repositories
- Catalogue processing and analysis
- Create automated analysis bash scripts
- Customise templates for analysis script generation

Project metadata is stored within a mysql database. Code is provided with some example analysis script pipelines which can be easily modified to work with existing workflows. This analysis script generation can help to standardise in-house processing and streamline pipelines.
