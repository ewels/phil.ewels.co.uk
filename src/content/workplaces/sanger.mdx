  During my undergraduate degree, I did a placement year at the Wellcome Sanger Institute:
  a research institute at the forefront of genomics research.

In between the second and third years of my degree at the University of Bristol,
I worked as an industrial placement student at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

I worked under Prof Panos Deloukas in the Sanger Genotyping Platform Group (Team 67).
We used the illumina MasArray genotyping platform and I spent most of my time
validating variants using the Sequenom MassArray platform.
This gave confidence about sample identity in the large scale projects that we were running.

The day-to-day lab work involved a lot of high-throughput genomics lab work.
I ran thousands of PCR reaction plates, became very familiar with different type of Taq enzyme
and spent a lot of time pipetting.
In addition to this, I also worked with the robotics platforms and some analysis work.

I was lucky enough to be involved in several papers coming out of the group,
including a [_Nature Genetics_ paper in 2007](/publications/2008/fisher-nature-genetics)
and a [2008 study](/publications/2008/baker-journal-of-clinical-microbiology)
on tracing _Salmonella enterica_ spread using genetic varation.
