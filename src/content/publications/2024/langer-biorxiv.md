## Abstract

Standardised analysis pipelines are an important part of FAIR bioinformatics research. Over the last decade, there has been a notable shift from point-and-click pipeline solutions such as Galaxy towards command-line solutions such as Nextflow and Snakemake. We report on recent developments in the nf-core and Nextflow frameworks that have led to widespread adoption across many scientific communities. We describe how adopting nf-core standards enables faster development, improved interoperability, and collaboration with the &gt;8,000 members of the nf-core community. The recent development of Nextflow Domain-Specific Language 2 (DSL2) allows pipeline components to be shared and combined across projects. The nf-core community has harnessed this with a library of modules and subworkflows that can be integrated into any Nextflow pipeline, enabling research communities to progressively transition to nf-core best practices. We present a case study of nf-core adoption by six European research consortia, grouped under the EuroFAANG umbrella and dedicated to farmed animal genomics. We believe that the process outlined in this report can inspire many large consortia to seek harmonisation of their data analysis procedures.
