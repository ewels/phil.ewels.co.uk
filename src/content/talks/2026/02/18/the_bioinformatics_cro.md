The Bioinformatics CRO is well known for its popular podcast
(check out [Episode 54](https://www.bioinformaticscro.com/podcast/evan-floden/), where they had Evan on to talk about Nextflow),
and the recently started a brand new webinar series.
They kindly invited me to join and speak about Nextflow and nf-core.

In this talk, I gave an overview of Nextflow and nf-core, focusing on some of the exciting new features from recent releases.
I covered the rewritten language parser with static types and strict syntax,
the VS Code extension and language server, and built-in data lineage tracking.
I also touched on Seqera Platform and how it fits into the picture for running pipelines at scale.
