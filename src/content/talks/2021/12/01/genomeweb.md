I was invited to be one of three speakers at a Genome Web webinar called
_"Managing Bioinformatics Pipelines in the Cloud to Do More Science"_.

> In this webinar, Phil Ewels, team leader for bioinformatics development at the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) at SciLifeLab, Brendan Bouffler, head of developer relations, HPC Engineering at Amazon Web Services, and Evan Floden, CEO of Seqera Labs, will discuss and demonstrate how bioinformaticians and data practitioners can create, manage and optimize their data pipelines with cloud-based systems, increasing productivity, reducing the need to manage IT infrastructure, and ultimately allowing them to do more science.
>
> Nextflow enables users to seamlessly run and scale reproducible genomics workflows locally, on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, or on major cloud providersâ€™ infrastructure. Developed since 2014 and backed by a fast-growing community, the Nextflow ecosystem is made up of users and developers across academia, government, and industry.
