I was kindly invited to take part at the 2025 ESS / MAX IV/ SciLifeLab Summit, organised by [Vetenskapsrådet](https://www.vr.se/) (the Swedish Research Council) and [Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/) at [The Loop](https://www.thelooplund.se/) in Science Village in Lund.

It was a lot of fun to there, with a very mixed group of researchers and industry users spanning biology, physics, material sciences and more. I got to have a tour of the [MAX IV](https://www.maxiv.lu.se/) facility which was super impressive, with great tour hosts.

## Event description

ESS, MAX IV and SciLifeLab will generate tens of petabytes of data every year through the experiments and measurements made at the facilities. One petabyte data is approximately equivalent to 250 billion mobile phone photos or one billion books.

These data are the basis for the research breakthroughs in all fields of science – if we have strategies for managing, utilizing, quality-assuring and making it all available. However, a recent study tells us that there are significant bottlenecks.

At this year’s Summit we will discuss how to manage data, machine learning and AI for science.

## My panel

My panel discussed the openness of AI and its use with large data.
You can find it on the live stream at 4:56:20 onwards.
