Invited to give a talk at the EMBL Scientific Workflow Club, an informal meeting where tech-oriented people meet to discuss pipelines and workflows in general.

As the group are already fans of scientific workflows and familiar with the nf-core, I took the opportunity to talk about the hidden side that keeps collaborative development moving as the community scales. Specifically, I touched on governance, automated test infrastructure and developer tooling.
