The nf-core Request for Comment (RFC) process is designed to give the community a voice and visibility to large projects that affect the entire community. In this bytesize, I gave an overview of the RFC process.

You can read more about how RFCs work in the [nf-core documentation](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/project_proposals).

RFCs are proposed and discussed in the [nf-core/proposals GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals).
