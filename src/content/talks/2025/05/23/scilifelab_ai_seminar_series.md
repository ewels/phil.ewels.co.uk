Invited to give a talk at the SciLifeLab AI Seminar.
This is part of a technical/methodological seminar series, formerly known as the _"NBIS Artificial Intelligence and Integrative Omics Seminar Series"_.

Unfortunately we had some issues with the Zoom meeting and then my live demo
of Seqera AI _"Pipeline Mode"_ was affected by a
[incident with Claude Sonnet 4](https://status.anthropic.com/incidents/ppkynb6d77s7),
so the talk ended with a bit of a whimper rather than a triumph,
but it was still a fun talk to give and was well received.

You can see the Nextflow Summit 2024 Boston talk where Sasha Dagayev launched
these new Seqera AI features
[on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxKLton2Gq0&list=PLPZ8WHdZGxmWF9fpFcrUuHiozeUZoLb65&t=765s).
