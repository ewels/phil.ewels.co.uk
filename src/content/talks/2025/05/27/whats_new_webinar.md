Hear from three product managers (including me) about new announcements
that were made at the 2025 Boston Nextflow Summit.

I talked about new features for Nextflow (new syntax parser, Nextflow lineage)
as well as updates to the Nextflow VS Code extension and Seqera AI.
Some slides but with a bunch of live demo too.
