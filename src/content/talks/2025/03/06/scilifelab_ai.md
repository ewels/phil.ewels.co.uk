Invited to give a talk at a SciLifeLab DDLS event:
Automation of research processes with LLMs and AI.

## Abstract

Nextflow has become the leading tool for scientific workflows in bioinformatics, but writing workflows can be challenging. This talk introduces Seqera AI, a new tool that helps generate Nextflow pipelines either from scratch, from existing scripts, or even other workflow languages. I'll discuss how Seqera AI is able to generate best-practice DSL2 code that follows nf-core guidelines, and how we go beyond just code generation: creating and running test suites with AI agents, streamlining development while improving code quality and validation.
