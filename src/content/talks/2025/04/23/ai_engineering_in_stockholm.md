Invited to give a talk at the "AI Engineering in Stockholm" meetup, as one of two speakers at a session for "Agents + LLMs in Practice":

> This meetup focuses on practical applications of LLMs and agents. Youâ€™ll hear how Seqera supports scientific research with AI tools and how Pocketlaw applies AI agents in legal services. No hype, just real-world use cases and lessons learned.

It was a really nice event - in person only with a strong focus on networking and discussion.
My talk was mostly based around live-demos rather than slides, and the talk ended up being part presentation and part discussion with the audience, which was great!

It's also always fun to present to a different group of people:
in this case, experts and developers working with AI, from all kinds of different industries.

Tools that I used in demos:

- [Seqera AI](https://seqera.io/ask-ai/)
- [Nextflow VS Code extension](http://nextflow.io/vscode)
- [MultiQC AI summaries](https://docs.seqera.io/multiqc/ai)
- [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/)
