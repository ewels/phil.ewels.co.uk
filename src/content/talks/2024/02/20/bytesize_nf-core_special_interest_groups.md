Introducing a brand new nf-core initiative: Special Interest Groups. The nf-core community is currently organised by pipeline and analysis type, but in practice scientists often use sets of pipelines - and the way that a given pipeline is used can vary across different fields. Special Interest Groups are a new way for nf-core community members to find others that are interested in the same subject / field, to learn from and encourage each other.

Phil Ewels (@ewels) is giving us an overview of all things nf-core Special Interest Groups.
