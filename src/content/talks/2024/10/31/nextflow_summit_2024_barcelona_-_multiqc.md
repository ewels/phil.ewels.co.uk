This talk will introduce the latest features in MultiQC, designed to further streamline data reporting and visualisation in bioinformatics workflows. Alongside these updates, weâ€™ll explore different approaches running for MultiQC: default CLI functionality, custom content files, writing custom plugins and using MultiQC as a library within Python scripts.

We'll show how to use this newly announced scripting ability to tweak how parsed data is processed: filtering results, adding additional columns to tables, and generating custom plots. These additions provide even greater flexibility in tailoring MultiQC to specific project needs.
