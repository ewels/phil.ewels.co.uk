Invited as a sole guest speaker for the first ever SciLifeLab Data Centre retreat, with the remit to give a talk about "something inspirational".
Had a great time thinking about big-picture questions and how our interleaved history complements these.
Lovely group of people, with something like 80 people present, it was a really nice event and an honour to be asked to attend.
