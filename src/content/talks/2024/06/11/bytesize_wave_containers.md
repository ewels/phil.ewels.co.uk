Wave is a container provisioning service integrated with Nextflow.
With Wave, you can build, upload, and manage the container images required by your data analysis workflows automatically and on-demand during pipeline execution.
Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) will show us in this bytesize the different ways of how wave can be utilized.

Phil will cover:

- The problems that Wave tries to solve (why you should care)
- An introduction to how Docker containers are made
- A breakdown of how Wave works
- How Wave helps with: speed of development, reproducibility, security, SBOMs, repository authorisation.
- Example usage of Wave using in Nextflow pipelines, using the Wave CLI and the API.
- Some ideas about how nf-core could make use of Wave in the future
