In the nf-core community we spend a lot of time helping people with problems that
they've hit when running Nextflow pipelines.

In this talk, I went over some of the more common failures and how best to troubleshoot these.
Importantly, I described where to start looking for issues and how to ask for help in the most effective way.

This bytesize talk has been referred to many times and was eventually
written up as a [documentation page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/troubleshooting) on the nf-core website.
