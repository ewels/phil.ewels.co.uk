A short nf-core/bytesize talk about how the `nf-core lint` command-line helper
script works, part of the [nf-core tools](https://nf-co.re/tools) package.

Linting helps ensure that pipelines follow nf-core guidelines and best practices.
By using linting configuration files, you can control how the tests run
so that they are useful for you and your pipeline - even if not destined for nf-core.
