The nf-core core team met in September 2022 for their first ever retreat.
A lot of topics were discussed, in this talk I described the key points and cover some of the future directions for the community.

- New organisational team structure
- Updates to guidelines, test-data and archiving policies
- Looking ahead:
  - Subworkflows
  - awesome-nextflow pipelines
  - nf-core website updates
