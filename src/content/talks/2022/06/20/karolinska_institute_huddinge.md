I was invited to give a talk as part of the educational bioinformatics seminar series that is
run at the Centre for bioinformatics and biostatistics, at the Karolinska Institute Huddinge campus.

### Abstract

As data volumes in the life sciences grow, it's increasingly necessary to use a workflow manager for bioinformatics analysis. Nextflow allows you to build scalable, portable pipelines which meet the highest standards of reproducibility. In this talk, Phil will cover the different ways in which you can use and contribute to the community-built open source pipelines available from nf-core: with beginner-friendly web interfaces right through to advanced command-line tinkering.
