At the start of 2022, nf-core joined the Nextflow community to do a joint survey entitled
_"The State of the Workflow 2022: Nextflow and nf-core community survey"_
(see the [announcement blog post](https://seqera.io/blog/the-state-of-the-workflow-the-2022-nextflow-and-nf-core-community-survey/)).
This follows on from the [2021 edition](https://seqera.io/blog/state-of-nextflow-2021-results/)
but with some additional questions, including some concerning nf-core community strength and engagement.

In this nf-core/bytesize talk, I gave an overview over the key results of the survey.
