The NextGenBug group describes itself as _"The meeting place for the next generation of bioinformaticians"_:

> The Next Generation Bioinformatics User Group (NextGenBUG) is a user-driven meeting programme that aims to build an engaged user community in Scotland (and beyond) of researchers and others analysing or exploiting large-volume data in biology. It has a major, but nonexclusive, focus on "next generation" sequence data analyses and interpretation.

I was invited to be a keynote speaker at the 2022 event in Edinburgh, Scotland.
I gave a talk with the title _"Adventures in Open Science"_ where I discussed how working with open source software projects has shaped my career.
