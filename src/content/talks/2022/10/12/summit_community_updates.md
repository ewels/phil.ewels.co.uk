The nf-core community collaborates to build a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow. We continuously develop best-practices for pipelines to enable reproducible, portable and scalable analysis workloads. Importantly, we focus on collaboration and openness, keeping one pipeline per data / analysis type to foster new contributions.

Started in 2018, nf-core has enjoyed explosive growth in parallel to the mass adoption of Nextflow. Our community contiunes to grow apace and now offers ready-to-run pipelines for nearly 70 different applications.

In this talk I introduced the project and gave an update on the latest and greatest achievements.
