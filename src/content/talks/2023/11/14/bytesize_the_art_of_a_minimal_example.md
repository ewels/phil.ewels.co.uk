A short nf-core/bytesize talk about troubleshooting and getting help, using "MREs", or minimal reproducible examples.

Warning: this talk contained a lot of gifs.

### Description

We all know how difficult it is to debug a complicated pipeline, but Phil (@ewels) is here to help! In this weeks bytesize talk, he will show us how to debug with a minimal reproducible example - a tiny pipeline that exhibits the buggy behavior.
