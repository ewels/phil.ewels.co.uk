BIOMEDAS is a PhD training program aimed at students interested in combining disciplinary knowledge with the skills of a data scientist and working at the interface of bioinformatics, medical informatics, databases, data mining, machine learning, applied mathematics, biomedical modeling and analysis of complex networks.

BIOMEDAS held its second retreat at the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) on 28th June 2023 and featured talks on the current research status in bioinformatics, medical informatics, databases, data mining, and machine learning, applied mathematics, biomedical modelling, and analyses of complex networks.

I was invited to join as keynote speaker, where I gave a talk entitled _"Open and reproducible bioinformatics with Nextflow & nf-core"_.
