Gave an invited talk at the SBW (Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop) meeting.
The event was based in Lund, but held as a hybrid meeting due to the ongoing Covid situation.

## Speaker Bio

Phil Ewels is the Team Leader for Bioinformatics development at the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) at SciLifeLab in Stockholm, Sweden. SciLifeLab is a national centre for molecular biosciences for Sweden; the NGI is the largest platform at SciLifeLab. We provide DNA library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis support for research groups across the country. He and his team focus on the development and scaling up of new lab protocols and bioinformatics solutions for the ISO accredited NGI Genomics Production facility. They develop new analysis pipelines and try to ensure that the tools they write are scalable, reproducible and transferable.

Phil has been working at SciLifeLab for seven years and moved to Sweden after a PhD and postdoc at the University of Cambridge and Babraham Institute in Cambridge, UK. He has has a history of lab and bioinformatics work in epigenetics and has a soft spot for software development with a focus on user friendliness. He is the co-founder of the nf-core community building best-practice Nextflow analysis pipelines and is the author of MultiQC, SRA-Explorer, QCFail.com and several other pet projects.
