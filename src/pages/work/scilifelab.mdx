    SciLifeLab is a centre for life sciences in Sweden.
    It's a collaboration between four Swedish universities (Stockholm Univeristy, Karolinska Institute, KTH, Uppsala University)

    I worked at the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI), a technology platform at SciLifeLab offering genomics as a service to researchers across Sweden and abroad.

    The NGI is a world-class centre and I was lucky to work with development of cutting edge library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics methods during my time there.

## Positions held

I worked at the NGI for a long time and held a range of different positions, working with bioinformatics, software engineering and management.

I worked witihn the Genomics Applications Development facility in Stockholm. The group develops and scales up new computation analyses and lab protocols for next-generation sequencing data in collaboration with users across Sweden.
