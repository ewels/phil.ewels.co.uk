        <ul><li>Whilst at the Babraham Institute I have been involved in the development of several bioinformatics tools including <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/" target="_blank">FastQC</a> (next-generation sequencing data quality control), <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/" target="_blank">Bismark</a> (bisulfite methylation analysis tool) and <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/" target="_blank">HiCUP</a> (Hi-C data processing pipeline). I have headed up two projects of my own: Labrador, a web based tool to find and access data processed by the Bioinformatics group; Cluster Flow, a pipeline package to automate and standardise common processing steps using our GRIDEngine cluster, written in Perl. I have released some tools for public use: <a href="http://www.tallphil.co.uk/bioinformatics" target="_blank">http://www.tallphil.co.uk/bioinformatics</a></li></ul></li>
    	<li>Coding Experience

    	<li>Presentation
        <ul><li>My PhD has required me to present my data in a number of talks. Senior members of staff have remarked that my presenting style is confident and clear. I have also presented my research in poster sessions at a number of events, including the 2011 BBSRC annual conference in Norwich.</li></ul></li>
    	<li>Project Management
        <ul><li>I am skilled at managing targets and deadlines, a necessity for my PhD which requires a great deal of independence and motivation. I am in charge of my work and responsible for organising my time.</li></ul></li>

    	<li>Boat Club Captain, <a title="Trinity Hall Boat Club" href="http://www.trinityhallbc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Trinity Hall Boat Club</a> (2009 - 2010)
        <ul><li>I have been rowing competitively since I was very young. I was elected captain of my college boat club at Cambridge. The captaincy involved a great deal of responsibility and organisation, co-ordinating the efforts of over 60 members and many alumni. As well as managing the day to day life of the boat club, I was also key in building up a number of administrative facilities for the boat club. I raised in excess of £53,000 through the organisation of fundraising events and was responsible purchasing new equipment. I am currently helping to orchestrate an ambitious plan to renovate the club boat house.</li></ul></li>
