The [Nextflow plugin registry](https://registry.nextflow.io/) is a central repository for discovering, sharing, and managing Nextflow plugins.

In this bytesize talk I discussed how Nextflow plugins used to be published and why we needed something new.
I gave a whistle-stop tour of the new registry and talked a little bit about how it works, and some of the new things that it enables us to do (like tell VSCode what config scopes plugins expose!).
